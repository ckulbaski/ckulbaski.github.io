== Projects

=== Mindful.ly
- https://github.com/scottjodoin/gratitude-prototype

This is a prototype for a mindfulness/gratitude app made for COMP 3020 (Human-Computer Interaction). It's written in Javascript and Bootstrap, and uses Chart.js to display the data.
The purpose of this project was to design a good user interface, rather than making a functional app, which is why the data is hard coded and static. 

=== "BudgeIt" Android app

My team and I used Agile software development to develop an app that is used to track spending and saving habits. We worked in Android Studio, which was part of a project for Software Engineering 1.  

=== SEO-ker
- https://seoker.herokuapp.com/

My Software Engineering 2 project was a multiplayer party game inspired by [Higher Lower Game](https://www.higherlowergame.com/) and poker. It was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

== Work Experience

I don't have any experience working in the computer science/software development industry right now. However, I have lots of experience that demonstrates that I am a good team member and have excellent communication skills. 

=== Manitoba Hydro - Digital & Technology Trainee program

Manitoba Hydro's D&T Trainee program rotates new graduates through 4 different fields over the course of 2 years, giving each employee experience in a new department every 6 months. 
- Data & Analytics. 
	- Earned certification in Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, Microsoft's cloud platform that Hydro is currently transitioning to. 
	- IBM COGNOS migration project. Developed reports in Microsoft Power BI to replace IBM COGNOS, which was becoming obsolete. 
	- Peakload Report Prototyping. Developed prototypes in Power BI as a proof-of-concept. The business was investigating the capabilities of Power BI to visualize real-time data from Aveva PI sensors in the field. 
- System Support.
	- UnitCyclingTool. This is an advisory tool built using ReactJS for the front end and C# for the back end. It is used by system operators to track which generation units were most recently turned on/off to reduce wear and tear. 
		- Debugged the tool to allow it to run successfully on the development server
		- Configured a DevOps pipeline to build and deploy the tool to Dev and Prod servers
		- Fixed miscellaneous UI bugs

I was a summer groundskeeper for all 78 schools in the Winnipeg School Division 1. I lead a team of students to cut grass, trim hedges, fix fences, aerate and soil fields, and many other groundskeeping tasks.

As a sales person I was responsible for quoting and selling lumber, hardware, doors, etc, as well as maintaining the store and lumber yard.

In my senior year of high school I spent 10 days in Tanzania immersing myself in Maasai culture. We helped build a school, and our money went towards building a well in a rural village. One of the greatest experiences of my life, I hope to return some day!
